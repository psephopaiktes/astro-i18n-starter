## Components

Inside `src/components/i18n/`, you will find several UI components that are useful for generating multilingual sites. Feel free to customize their content and import them as needed.

### LocaleSelect.astro
A select UI for switching between languages.

### LocaleSelectSingle.astro
A link UI to another language. Use this when you only support two languages.

### LocalesHomeList.astro
Returns a list of links to the top pages of each language, wrapped in `<li>` tags.

### LocaleSuggest.astro
Displays a UI at the top suggesting a link to the browser's language when the user accesses a URL different from their browser's language.

For example, if a user with English settings accesses the URL `/ja/[slug]`, it suggests a link to `/en/[slug]`.

Once closed, the setting is saved on localhost and will not be displayed again.

### LocaleHtmlHead.astro
Allows you to specify `<head>` tag settings for each locale. The sample code loads the [Noto Font](https://fonts.google.com/noto/) for each language and applies the CSS.

### NotTranslateCaution.astro
Displays a warning to the user when a specific page is only available in a certain language.

The sample page is [Monolingual](/monolingual/). When this page is viewed in a language other than English, it displays a warning UI to the user.

The text for the warning UI is set in `/src/const.ts` in the sample code.



## 404

The { SITE_TITLE } 404 page consists of two files. If you want to customize the design of the 404 page, you generally only need to edit `src/pages/[lang]/404.astro`.

### src/pages/404.astro

This file generates the following:

> /404.html

Most deploy services will find and use this file when a page is not found.

When accessed with { SITE_TITLE }, it redirects to the following 404 page based on the user's system language:

<details>
    <summary>Detailed Redirect Conditions</summary>
    The redirect is performed based on the following conditions. For more details, please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/psephopaiktes/astro-i18n-starter/blob/main/src/pages/404.astro#L25).

    1. If the URL contains `/ja/...` or any other language code.
    2. If the `localStorage.selectedLang` contains the language code.
        * The `localStorage.selectedLang` is saved when the user selects a language in the UI.
    3. If the referring page contains `/ja/...` or any other language code.
</details>

### src/pages/[lang]/404.astro

This file dynamically generates the following:

> * /en/404/index.html
> * /ja/404/index.html
> * ...

Actually, by `history.replaceState()` process displays the URL the user accessed before the redirect in the browser


## CSS Tips

### Separating CSS for each language

You can separate the definitions using CSS alone by writing as follows:

```css
:lang(en) {
    /* Styles for English */
}
:lang(ar) {
    /* Styles for Arabic */
}
```

However, in this case, all language CSS will be loaded simultaneously, resulting in wasted resources.

If you are writing inside `.astro` files, consider writing as follows or separating the definitions within [LocaleHtmlHead.astro](#localehtmlheadastro).

```astro
---
import { type Lang } from "@/i18n";
const locale = Astro.currentLocale as Lang;
---

{
    locale === "en" ? (
        <style>
            /* Styles for English */
        </style>
    )
    : locale === "ar" ? (
        <style>
            /* Styles for Arabic */
        </style>
    )
    : null
}
```


### Letter-spacing for Arabic

In some designs, you may want to adjust the letter-spacing for headings and other elements. However, it is important not to add spacing for Arabic text.

> [Right-to-left Styling](https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling#1.-letter-spacing)

Therefore, please note that { SITE_TITLE } defines the following in `src/styles/base.css`:

```css
:lang(ar) {
    * { letter-spacing: 0 !important; }
}
```


### RTL Icons

In RTL languages, icons such as arrows need to be mirrored.

> [Right to left | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left#Interface-icons)

{ SITE_TITLE } uses [Material Icon](https://fonts.google.com/icons), and the following is defined in `src/styles/base.css`:

```css
[class^="material-icons"]:dir(rtl).dir {
    scale: -1 1;
}
```

By adding the `.dir` class, the icons will be mirrored in RTL languages.

```html
<span class="material-icons-sharp dir">arrow_forward</span>
```

Actual display: 
<span class="material-icons-sharp dir">arrow_forward</span>
<span class="material-icons-sharp dir">open_in_new</span>
